Chronos Engine Website
======================

Local development
-----------------
- Open `Website/index.html` in a browser (no build needed), or
- Serve the `Website/` folder with a static server for cleaner URLs.

GitHub Pages
------------
- Publish the contents of `Website/` to your Pages source (root or `gh-pages` branch).
- `CNAME` and `.nojekyll` are included for custom domain and asset passthrough.
- Update links if you publish from a subpath (e.g., `/Chronos-Engine/`).

Custom domain
-------------
- Set a DNS CNAME record for `chronosengine.online` â†’ `<your-username>.github.io`.
- Keep the `Website/CNAME` file set to `chronosengine.online`.
